## What is UBC AeroDesign?

UBC AeroDesign (formerly known as UBC Heavy Lift) was founded in 1992 by a group of engineering students.  Every year, the team upholds the tradition of designing and building a radio-controlled fixed-wing aircraft to attend the collegiate competition organized by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE). The SAE Aero Design Series competition challenges university students from around the world to design and build a plane with the purpose of lifting the heaviest payload.
 
UBC AeroDesign has grown into a diverse team composed of talented university students from all disciplines. The team’s passion for all things aviation and desire to enrich student educational experience has pushed us to success. The team maintains a tradition of excellence: with over forty teams participating in the SAE competition, the team has placed in the top ten, over 20 times in its history.


### The team has two overarching missions:
 
1. To provide a learning environment for students to experiment and experience what it is like to work on a world class engineering challenge in the field of aerospace.

2. To produce the most competitive and innovative designs for international university competitions.


### Design Team Structure

The UBCAD Design Team is split into two teams: Regular Class and Advanced Class, which corresponds to the competitions we attend (for more information about the two classes, check out our "Competition" page here. 

UBC AeroDesign is split into 8 sub-teams, each lead by a sub-team lead, and may be further split into specializations. Members will generally operate under the broader sub-team category and assigned to specializations when necessary within their own sub-team. However, more dedicated members may choose to be part of multiple sub-teams upon approval of subteam leaders.
